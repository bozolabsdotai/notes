Below is step by step process to bring up your development environment using HortonSandbox

1. Download ova file using the link http://hortonassets.s3.amazonaws.com/2.2/Sandbox_HDP_2.2_VMware.ova
2. After downloading import this vm using vmplayer(free or licensed). I am using licensed one. Do not start the VM.
3. Goto Edit Virtual Machine Settings->Network Adapter->Select Bridged and also check "Replicate physical network connection state".
4. Increase the memory to 13GB(My system has 16GB RAM).
5. Now power on the VM.
6. Once the boot up is complete press "Alt + F5" to get into the console. Booted OS is CentOS6
7. Login using "root/hadoop" credential.
8. On console check whether internet has been detected by the booted OS or not using "ping www.google.co.in". 
   Right response means we are good to go. If something is wrong with the network fix that first before proceeding. 
   Make sure the internet is detected by the booted OS.
9. Now the VM does not has GUI like one Cloudera QuickStart has. But luckily this is a CentOS so we can arrange for that.
10. Run below command to install Desktop and Related Utilities
   #yum -y yum -y groupinstall "Desktop" "Desktop Platform" "X Window System" "Fonts" "vim" "firefox"
    Completion of this command may take some time.It may download and install around 180MB of files.
11. We are not done yet. System currently boots in console mode. We need to change it to GUI mode. 
   #vim /etc/inittab
   Locate the following line “id:3:initdefault:” and change the number value from 3 (default) to 5
12. Reboot the system
13. Now if everything has gone right system should boot in GUI mode. It will display all user in the system
    except the root user. Select "other" and login using "root/hadoop".
14. We are not done yet. If you want Ctrl+C Ctrl+V functionality between your Windows Host and Booted VM you 
   need to install VMWare Tool. Goto VMWare Player->VM->Install/Reinstall VMware Tools.
   This should bring up "VMware Tool" option on your desktop. Now we will install it. Please follow following steps:
15. #cd /media/VMware Tool
16. #cp VMwareTools*.tar.gz /tmp
17. #cd /tmp
18. #tar xvf VMwareTools*.tar.gz
19. #cd vmware-tools-distrib
20. #./vmware-install.pl
21. Accept all the default options by simply pressing enter on all the options.
22. Upon successful exit. Reboot the VM. After reboot it will display all user in the system
    except the root user. Select "other" and login using "root/hadoop".
